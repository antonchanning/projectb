<h1>BlockPress in Github Pages</h1>

<p>You are looking at an instance of BlockPress code running in Github Pages.</p>

<h2>A BlockPress use case</h2>

<p>What does this mean? It means github projects that have a steem
based blog, can now use blockpress for their github pages, and embed their blog directly.
Every time they post a new blog, or someone replies with a comment, it will be instantly
available on their github pages.</p>

<p>Such a blockpress user will be able to take advantage of our range of themes and palettes,
  or easily create their own.</p>

<p>And this is just the start, as blockpress development continues and we add new features
  and modules, such a site will be able to take advantage of an inceasing range of content
  options!</p>
