    <p><strong>Blockpress.me</strong> is an entirely front end web program,
      written in java script and jquery. It allows the user to create highly
      customisable and themable websites, that can make use of ajax loading
      content modules to pull data from multiple javascript apis, including
      steem, decent and bitshares.</p>

    <h2>Examples uses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Making multiple websites streaming content from a single steem user and using selected group of tags.
      <br>
      You can post everything using one login on steemit.com and use tags to create separate blog sites for your personal and  professional content (or anything you are passionate about!)</li>
      <li> Making a single website streaming content from a multiple users and select group of tags.
      <br>
      If you happen to have multiple accounts for your art or programming, you can use Blockpress to stream them together in one blog. This way you can showcase all your work in one place.</li>
      <li>Creating a forum website that streams all content from single or  multiple tags to create forum categories.</li>
      <li>Creating a moderated forum website that streams  all content from single or  multiple tags but a select group of users.
      <br>
      <li>If a user spams a tag, you can remove them from your Blockpress stream. This gives you a quality control over the content displayed on your website.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Selling decent based content on your steem based media blog.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Displaying relevant crypto charts on your crypto themed blog.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Displaying relevant crypto charts on a private VNP based site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Developement</h2>
    <p>Implementing the modules that load the content in the various ways
      listed above to integrate content from multiple blockchains and sites.</p>
