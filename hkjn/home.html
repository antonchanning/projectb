<h1>About Henrik</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://hkjn.me">Henrik</a> registered the blockpress.me domain and built
some <a href="https://github.com/hkjn/blockpress.me">server-side support</a>
for the <a href="https://github.com/miblodge/projectb">static frontend content</a>.
</p>

<p>Henrik is fascinated by the decentralized and permissionless systems that
are now possible, starting with Bitcoin, and is working full-time on understanding
them better and helping out where he can.</p>

<p>His personal blockpress.me site will contain price feeds for cryptocurrencies,
posts from <a href="https://steemit.com/@hkjn">SteemIt</a>, donations via Bitcoin
and similar.</p>
