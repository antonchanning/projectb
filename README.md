# Blockpress.me
[Blockpress.me](https://blockpress.me) is a javascript/jquery content management system that uses various blockchains for backend storage, loaded via ajax modules. The project began life at the Lisbon Steemfest Hackathon on Nov 1, 2017. 

## Example websites showing off different themes
Each of these three example sites using blockpress.me are inspired by the three developers. Each is used as an example of a different use case. 
- https://anton.blockpress.me
- https://dana.blockpress.me
- https://hkjn.blockpress.me

## Server side setup
See also https://github.com/hkjn/blockpress.me, where the server-side setup lives. This pulls data for the blockpress website, and the three example sites, directly from four subfolders in the https://github.com/miblodge/projectb repository.
